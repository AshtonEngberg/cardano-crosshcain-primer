__Here is where I'll push the work produced for the purpose of interoperability.__

The rubric to fulfill such an evaluation of a blockchain network is to be determined with the aid of communities members but would look something like:
 * which blockchain 
 * genesis/current statistics and facts
 * roadmap of development; current status and target future milestones
 * smart contract programming langauge(s) and/or mechanisms of action
 * notable implementations
 * potential interchain interfaces, ie ability to work with another blockchain network
 * contacts who might be useful to talk to for the purposes of interchain integration

However this likely be polished and changed to form upon constructive input from community members as well as the review of a given blockchain will be compared and contrasted to Cardano for the purposes of claritiy and relatable.
 
The researched blockchains will come from a priority queue decided upon by similar constructive feedback, and a table of contents will be updated to reflect the added information. This list will initially start with Cardano, which will give a base line for subsequent reviews.
